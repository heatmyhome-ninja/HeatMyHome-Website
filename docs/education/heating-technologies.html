            <h1>Air Source Heat Pump</h1>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Heat pumps take heat from the external environment and distribute
              that heat throughout your home. Air Source Heat Pumps are small
              outdoor units which use electricity to convert solar energy from
              the outside air into electricity for domestic heating. Domestic
              air source heat pumps are one of the most affordable and
              cost-efficient heating solutions in the UK.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Heat Pump?</h3>
            <p>
              A heat pump is a system that utilises mechanical work to move heat
              from a cold location to a hot location. This is made possible by
              an external heat exchanger, which collects heat from the
              environment, and an internal heat exchanger, which distributes the
              heat into the home with the help of a compressor.
            </p>
            <p>
              The efficiency of a heat pump is a crucial parameter in
              determining the savings it can offer. The Coefficient of
              Performance of a heat pump, or COP, is a commonly used measure for
              assessing heat pump performance. The COP showcases how many units
              of heat are produced per unit of electricity used by the
              compressor. For example, a COP of 3 means that 3 watts of heat are
              produced for each watt of electricity consumed.
            </p>
            <h3>What is an Air Source Heat Pump?</h3>
            <p>
              An Air Source Heat Pump, or ASHP, is a distinct type of heat pump
              which relies on heat collection from the air. They can be used for
              both water and space heating. Air source heat pumps have an
              average Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 3.2. There are two
              types of Air Source Heat Pumps:
            </p>
            <ul class="fmt">
              <li>
                <b>Air-to-Water Heat Pump:</b> the heat collected from the
                outside environment heats up the water inside a tank, which is
                then distributed around the house through conventional systems
                such as radiators and underfloor heating.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Air-to-Air Heat Pump:</b> this system collects warm air and
                then distributes the heat using fans throughout the household.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul class="fmt plus">
              <li>
                <b>Reasonable Capital Costs: </b> Although more expensive than
                conventional heating systems, ASHPs are the cheapest carbon-free
                heating solution. The cost of an ASHP in the UK is typically in
                the region of £2,500 – 5,000.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Low Operational Costs:</b> Depending on the COP, an ASHP can
                be much cheaper to run than alternatives such as full electric
                systems, oil boiler, or gas boilers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Space Saving:</b> The external heat exchanger of an ASHP is
                small in size and can be placed at the user’s discretion.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Carbon Emission Reduction:</b> An ASHP produces no carbon
                emissions on site, as no fuel is burned in the process. If the
                electricity used by an ASHP is from renewable sources, then the
                process is carbon free.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Heating & Cooling:</b> An ASHP is used to heat up domestic
                spaces during cold months, but it can also double as a cooling
                system during summer.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Less Maintenance:</b> ASHPs require less maintenance compared
                to combustion-based heating systems.

            <ul class="fmt minus">
              <li>
                <b>Medium Installation Costs:</b> ASHPs are similar to standard
                heating equipment in terms of installation costs, ranging
                between £6,000 to £10,000.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Dependence on Temperature:</b> ASHPs performance highly
                depend on the ‘lift’: the temperature difference between the
                external heat collector and the output to the home. To maximise
                efficiency, the difference between the temperatures must be as
                small as possible. Therefore, an ASHP is suited for certain
                environments better than for others.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Noise:</b> The external heat exchanger unit can be noisy,

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Heat pumps take heat from the external environment and distribute
              that heat throughout your home. Ground Source Heat Pumps are
              underground systems which use electricity to extract heat from the
              ground to heat up your home.

            <h3>What is an Ground Source Heat Pump?</h3>
            <p>
              A Ground Source Heat Pump, or GSHP, is a distinct type of heat
              pump which relies on heat collection from the ground. They can be
              used for both water and space heating. A GSHP has on average, a
              Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 3.5 to 4.5. While ASHPs can be
              retrofitted to a domestic property at any time, ground source heat
              pumps are more suited to new builds.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two types of ground source heat pumps, the open loop
              system, and the closed loop system. An open loop GSHP system
              relies on access to a groundwater source, from where it extracts
              heat, while a closed loop GSHP system extracts heat directly from
              the ground. The closed loop GSHP system is most common for
              domestic heating purposes, as it does not require proximity of
              water bodies. There are two types of closed loop GSHP systems:
            </p>
            <ul class="fmt">
              <li>
                <b>Horizontal GSHP:</b> For this type of GSHP, a network of
                copper or plastic tubes is buried underground horizontally at a
                depth of 1-2 m. This method is common for properties which have
                more land available, as a horizontal ground source heat pump
                system requires a land area 2 to 4 times larger than the
                domestic floor area. Therefore, for the average 150 m<sup
                  >2</sup
                >
                home, between 300-600 m<sup>2</sup> of land area are required.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Vertical GSHP:</b> For this type of GSHP, vertical boreholes,
                6 m deep on average, are used to lay the pipes. Vertical
                boreholes are a more expensive alternative to the horizontal
                system, and it is more suitable for urban and suburban areas
                where space is limited.

            <h1>Electric Boiler</h1>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Electric boilers are an efficient and popular heating technology
              which represent a good alternative to gas boilers. An electric
              boiler differentiates itself from regular gas boilers through
              using electricity to operate rather than combustible fossil fuels.
            </p>
            <h3>What is an Electric Boiler?</h3>
            <p>
              The way in which an electric boiler produces heat is very simple;
              water flows through an element of the boiler which is heated using
              electricity. After running through the boiler, the water passes
              through the heating systems of your home, such as radiators and
              underfloor heating, therefore increasing the temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Electric boilers are usually mounted on the wall, or placed on the
              floor in a home. Although electric boilers can be used as
              standalone heating sources for homes, this technology is commonly
              used as a booster for central heating systems, especially during
              colder months.

                <b>Silent:</b> Electric boilers are usually mounted on the wall,
                or placed on the floor in a home. Although electric boilers can
                be used as standalone heating sources for homes, this technology
                is commonly used as a booster for central heating systems,

            <h1>Hydrogen Boiler</h1>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Hydrogen boilers are seen as the simplest solution to the nation’s
              heating problems by industry experts. Hydrogen boilers are adapted
              gas boilers which produce heat through burning a mixture of
              hydrogen and natural gas. Although uncommon, hydrogen boilers are
              perceived as the future of domestic heating in the United Kingdom,
              since they are a carbon free alternative.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Hydrogen Boiler?</h3>
            <p>
              Simply put, a hydrogen boiler is a repurposed gas boiler, which
              can burn either natural gas, or pure hydrogen. Hydrogen is an
              alternative fuel to methane and differentiates itself by producing
              no carbon emissions upon consumption.
            </p>
            <p>
              Converting a conventional gas boiler into a hydrogen-ready boiler
              is a simple process lasting around one hour, as only a couple of
              components need to be changed. The conversion can only be done by
              gas engineers trained to work with hydrogen by a qualification
              scheme!
            </p>
            <h3>What is Hydrogen?</h3>
            <p>
              Hydrogen is the simplest of all elements as it is made up only
              from one proton and one electron. This means that hydrogen rarely
              exists by itself and is rather combined with other elements, such
              as oxygen in order to form water for example. Hydrogen represents
              a clean energy source which, when extracted from various sources,
              can serve as a fuel for domestic heating. There are three types of
              Hydrogen:

            <ul class="fmt">
              <li>
                <b>Green Hydrogen:</b> Green hydrogen is obtained when passing a
                high current through water, resulting in the separation of
                oxygen and hydrogen atoms, a process referred to as
                electrolysis. This process is costly, as large amounts of
                electricity are needed to separate the two elements. The
                obtained hydrogen is called green hydrogen, as no CO<sub>2</sub>
                is emitted if the used electricity stems from renewable sources.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Blue Hydrogen:</b> Blue hydrogen is obtained by two
                processes: steam-methane reforming and Carbon Capture
                Utilisation Storage (CCUS). Steam-methane is a process of
                separating carbon and hydrogen in methane, and it results in a
                large quantity of emissions. Therefore, CCUS systems are used in
                order to prevent carbon from being released into the atmosphere.
                Higher quantities of hydrogen can be produced through
                steam-methane reforming than through electrolysis.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Grey Hydrogen:</b> Similarly to blue hydrogen, grey hydrogen
                is produced through steam-methane reformation. However, in this
                case the CCUS technology is not used, resulting into carbon
                dioxide and carbon monoxide emissions.

              <li>
                <b>High Efficiency:</b> Using hydrogen as an energy source
                provides 2 to 3 times more power upon burning than fossil fuels.

            <h1>Hydrogen Fuel Cell</h1>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Hydrogen fuel cells use the chemical energy of hydrogen to produce
              electricity. Hydrogen fuel cells produce clean energy, as their
              only by-products are water, heat, and most importantly,
              electricity. This technology has a variety of applications, among
              which is domestic heating. Hydrogen fuel cells represent a simple
              and viable heating alternative for the British market, as this
              technology is cleaner and more efficient than the conventional
              solutions such as gas boilers.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Hydrogen Fuel Cell?</h3>
            <p>
              A hydrogen fuel cell works like a battery, but unlike a battery,
              they do not need to be recharged if the fuel (hydrogen) is
              supplied. Each hydrogen fuel cell has and electrolyte membrane and
              two electrodes: an anode (negative), and a cathode (positive). The
              reaction that produces electricity happens between these
              electrodes and consists of the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol class="fmt">
              <li>
                Hydrogen atoms are distributed to the anode, while oxygen atoms
                are distributed to the cathode.
              </li>
              <li>
                The hydrogen atoms are separated into protons and electrons.
              </li>
              <li>
                While the protons move towards the cathode, the electrons are
                forced through a circuit in order to generate electricity.
              </li>
              <li>
                4While the protons move towards the cathode, the electrons are

            <p>
              The process through which a hydrogen fuel cell produces
              electricity is showcased in the figure above. Singular hydrogen
              fuel cells do not produce enough electricity, therefore, for
              domestic heating purposes, they need to be arranged into stacks.

            <h1>Biomass Boiler</h1>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Biomass Boilers are a similar technology to conventional gas
              boilers, but they use biomass such as sustainable wood pellets as
              their fuel source instead of methane. Using wood from landfill
              sources as fuel has an important environmental impact, as the
              carbon dioxide emissions produced during combustion are
              compensated for by the CO2 absorbed by the tree while it was
              growing. Therefore, biomass boilers are essentially carbon
              neutral. Biomass boilers are a viable domestic heating alternative
              to conventional gas boilers by industry experts.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Biomass Boiler?</h3>
            <p>
              A biomass boiler works the same way as a conventional gas boiler:
              fuel is burned in order to produce heat. The key difference
              between a biomass boiler and their fossil-fuel burning brothers is
              represented by the fuel used to produce the heat. Fitting for
              their name, biomass boilers use biomass as a fuel source for
              producing heat. Given the fuel source difference, biomass boilers
              are significantly larger than conventional boilers. This is
              because the combustion chamber needs to be larger in order to
              accommodate the volume of the biomass.
            </p>
            <p>
              Biomass boilers can come with systems that automatically feed
              biological materials into the combustion chamber, or this can be
              done manually by the homeowner. Biomass combustion produces hot
              gasses and air, which travel to a heat exchanger. Here, the heat
              is transferred to the water used in the property’s central heating
              system. It is important to understand that a biomass boiler is
              different from a traditional chimney!
            </p>
            <h3>Biomass Fuel Types</h3>
            <p>
              Biomass is a term that refers to any type of organic matter. In an
              energy context, biomass is any organic matter than can be used to
              generate energy, such as wood for example. There are various types
              of biomass fuel available, with different costs and efficiencies.
              The following biomass types are used as fuel for biomass boilers:
            </p>
            <ul class="fmt">
              <li>
                <b>Wood Chips:</b> This is the cheapest type of biomass fuel and
                is best suited for medium to large scale biomass boilers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Wood Pellets:</b> This biomass type is made from excess
                material resulting from wood manufacturing and is slightly more
                expensive than wood chips. As wood pellets are dense and
                compact, this is the most efficient form of biomass fuel.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Logs:</b> Logs can be expensive unless you have free access
                to wood. Moreover, logs need spacious storage availability.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Non-Wood Biomass:</b> Agricultural waste such as wheat and
                straws can be used as fuel in biomass boilers.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each year, approximately 8.5 million tonnes of wood go into
              landfill in the UK. This could be used to fuel biomass boilers.
            </p>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul class="fmt plus">
              <li>
                <b>Renewable:</b> Biomass is a fuel that can be regenerated

                <b>Carbon Neutral:</b> The carbon dioxide release through
                combustion is later re-absorbed by growing plants.

              <li>
                <b>Waste Reduction:</b> Biomass boilers help dispose of wood
                waste.

              <li>
                <b>Low Operational Prices:</b> The price of biomass fuel is
                considerably lower than of gas or electricity.

            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <ul class="fmt minus">
              <li>
                <b>Additional Space:</b> Biomass boilers are larger than
                conventional boilers, therefore needing more space. Moreover,
                homeowners also need storage facilities for biomass boilers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>High Capital Costs:</b> Biomass boilers are more expensive
                than conventional gas boilers. Moreover, biomass boilers also
                have higher installation costs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Ideal Storage Conditions:</b> As biomass fuel needs to remain
                dry in order to burn efficiently, it requires optimal storage
                conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Less Convenient:</b> Biomass boilers require more work from
                homeowners, as the fuel needs to be supplied continuously
                (unless an automated hopper system is used).
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Cleaning:</b> Biomass boilers need to be cleaned on a regular
                basis, about once every week.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Need for a Supplier:</b> Homeowners opting for a biomass
                boiler need to have their biomass fuel delivered on a regular
                basis by an independent supplier.
