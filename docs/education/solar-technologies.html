            <h1>Photovoltaic Panels</h1>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Photovoltaic panels, also known as solar panels, collect energy
              from the sun and convert it into electricity. Domestic
              photovoltaic panels generate electricity in order to produce heat,
              as well as for powering up household appliances. Given that the
              sun’s energy is a renewable source, the electricity produced by
              photovoltaic panels is clean and carbon free. Photovoltaic panels
              are becoming an increasingly popular heating technology among
              homeowners, especially in remote areas where there are little
              alternatives for other sources of electricity.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Photovoltaic Panel?</h3>
            <p>
              Solar panels are made up of small photovoltaic cells that are
              connected, hence the name PV panels. Each panel consists of many
              cells. The photovoltaic cells are made from a semiconducting
              material, most commonly silicone.
            </p>
            <p>
              When sun rays shine over the silicone photovoltaic cells, an
              electric field is created, and hence electricity is produced. The
              sun rays do not need to shine directly on the cells, however, the
              more direct the sunlight is, the more electricity is produces.
            </p>
            <h3>Types of Photovoltaic Panels</h3>
            <p>There are three common types of domestic PV panels:</p>
            <ul class="fmt">
              <li>
                <b>Monocrystalline PV Panels:</b> This type of panel is made
                from a single piece of silicone. Therefore, it is most
                efficient, but also most expensive out of the three options.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Polycrystalline PV Panels:</b> This type of panel is mad out
                of multiple silicone pieces which are melted together. This PV
                panel is less efficient than the monocrystalline panels, but
                also more affordable.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Thin-film PV Panels:</b> This is the cheapest and least
                efficient type of solar panel; however, it is ideal for
                applications where great flexibility is required.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The most popular photovoltaic panel system is the grid-connected
              system. This allows electricity to be drawn from the national grid
              at times when the PV panels are inactive, such as at night for
              example. The alternative to a grid-connected system is the
              stand-alone system. This system uses solar batteries in order to
              store electricity produced throughout the day so it can be used
              later.
            </p>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul class="fmt plus">
              <li>
                <b>Low Operational Costs:</b> As photovoltaic panels use solar
                energy to produce electricity, their operational cost is
                essentially zero. The only operational costs are associated with
                the price of electricity in instances where electricity is drawn
                from the grid.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Feed in Tariff (FiT):</b> This scheme allows homeowners with
                photovoltaic panels systems to earn money by exporting surplus
                electricity back to the national grid. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Environmentally Friendly:</b> Photovoltaic panels account for
                no CO2 emissions, as they provide clean, green energy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Renewable Energy:</b> Solar energy is supplied by nature and
                does not have a limited supply.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Low Maintenance Cost:</b> Photovoltaic panels have lower
                maintenance costs compared with other renewable energy systems.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Silent:</b> PV panels have no moving parts, and therefore are
                totally silent.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Easy to Install:</b> PV panel system can be installed to
                existing properties, without any disturbance to the residential
                lifestyle. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Support:</b> PV panels can be easily integrated with other
                heating technologies in order to meet the household demands.

                cloudy or rainy periods. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>High Capital Costs:</b> PV panels are one of the most

            <h1>Evacuated Tube Solar Thermal Collector</h1>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              While photovoltaic panels use the sun’s energy to produce
              electricity, evacuated tube systems harness the sun’s energy by
              converting the radiation into heat, which is later used to heat up
              the water in the home’s central heating system. Given that the
              sun’s energy is a renewable source, the heat generated by
              evacuated tube system is clean and carbon free. Evacuated tubes
              have already been used across the world as a water heating
              technology.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Evacuated Tube Solar Thermal Collector?</h3>
            <p>
              An evacuated tube collector system consists of rows of parallel,
              transparent glass tubes supported on a frame. Each individual tube
              consists of two components, a thick outer glass tube, and a
              thinner inner glass tube. Both tubes are made from extremely
              strong glass. The inner glass tube, also called ‘thermos-flask
              tube’ is coated with a special substance that absorbs solar energy
              while preventing heat loss.
            </p>
            <p>
              The air between the tubes is evacuated, forming a vacuum between
              the two glass layers, as this plays an important role in the
              performance of evacuated tubes. There is a metal heat pipe
              attached to an absorber plate inside each inner glass tube. The
              role of the absorber plate is to transfer heat from the tube to
              the liquid flowing through the metal heat pipe. The heated liquid
              then travels to a copper heat exchanger, where cold water flows in
              and hot water flows out. The hot water is then stored into a very
              well-insulated hot water tank, so that it can be used throughout
              the night or even the next day.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most important aspects of evacuated tube collectors is
              the installation angle, as performance and efficiency depends on
              this factor. The installation angle largely depends on the
              latitude of the location. Similarly, to photovoltaic panels,
              evacuated tube collectors can be installed on the roof of a
              property but are not limited to this. In some cases, evacuated
              tube systems can be mounted independently outside the house, in
              the garden for example.

            <h1>Flat Plate Solar Thermal Collector</h1>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Similarly, to evacuated tube collectors, flat plate collectors
              harness the sun’s energy by converting the radiation into heat,
              which is later used to heat up the water in the home’s central
              heating system. Given that the sun’s energy is a renewable source,
              the heat generated by flat plate collector systems is clean and
              carbon free. Flat Plate Collectors have already been used across
              the world as a water heating technology.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Flat Plate Solar Thermal Collector?</h3>
            <p>
              The main component of a flat plate collector system is the heat
              absorbing plate, usually made from copper or aluminium, as these
              two materials are good heat conductors. The heat absorbing plate
              is covered with a black coating so that it can absorb as much
              solar radiation as possible. In order to absorb solar energy, the
              flat plate needs to be installed with the heat absorbing plate
              facing towards the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Parallel copper pipes are soldered lengthways directly beneath the
              heat absorbing plate, so that there is maximum contact surface
              between the two components. The central water heating system is
              connected to the flat plate collector, so that water flows through
              the copper pipes. Therefore, when sunlight heats the heat
              absorbing plate, heat gets conducted through the copper pipes,
              heating the water flowing through them. The heat absorbing plate
              together with the copper pipes are enclosed in a well-insulated
              box in order to maximise the efficiency of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, to other solar heating technologies, flat plate
              collectors can be installed on the roof of a property but are not
              limited to this. In some cases, flat plate systems can be mounted
              independently outside the house, in the garden for example. A flat
              plate collector system needs a hot water tank for the hot water to
              be stored.

            <h1>Photovoltaic/Thermal Hybrid Solar Collector</h1>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              A photovoltaic/thermal hybrid solar system, or PVT system for
              simplicity, is a combination of both photovoltaic and solar
              thermal components which produce both electricity and heat from
              one integrated system. Given that the sun’s energy is a renewable
              source, the heat and electricity generated by photovoltaic/thermal
              hybrid systems are clean and carbon free. Photovoltaic/thermal
              hybrid solar collectors have been developed since the 1970s and
              represent an ideal method for producing both electricity and heat
              for a domestic property.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Photovoltaic/Thermal Hybrid Solar Collector?</h3>
            <p>
              A PVT collector combines photovoltaic and thermal technologies
              into one system in order to produce both electricity and hot
              water. A PVT collector consists of several layers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first layer is constituted by the photovoltaic module, made of
              photovoltaic cells. When sun rays shine over the silicone
              photovoltaic cells, an electric field is created, and hence
              electricity is produced. As a result of this process, the PV
              module retains heat, which is conducted through the thermal grease
              and the absorber to the serpentine tube, which is connected to the
              central heating system of the property. Therefore, the water
              flowing through the serpentine copper tube heats up and is there
              stored in the hot water tank.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a large variety of Photovoltaic-Thermal Hybrid Collectors
              designs, as these depends on the different applications required.
              Some systems have a greater focus on generating electricicty,
              while others have a greater focus on generating heat.
            </p>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul class="fmt plus">
              <li>
                <b>Low Operational Costs:</b> As PVT collectors use solar energy
                to produce hot water and electricity, their operational cost is
                essentially zero. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Environmentally Friendly:</b> PVT collectors account for no
                CO2 emissions, as they provide clean, green energy.

                <b>High Capital Costs:</b> PVT collector systems are
                considerably more expensive than either photovoltaic or thermal
                systems.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Interdependence:</b> The operation of the photovoltaic system
                depends on the operation of the thermal system, and vice-versa. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Weather Dependency:</b> Despite being more efficient than
                other technologies, PVT collectors still depend on the weather.
