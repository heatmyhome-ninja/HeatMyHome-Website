                This page provides an overview of how the simulator works. For
                full details on the heating model read the journal article,
                which will be linked here shortly. The source code for the
                website and heating simulator, along with documentation, can be

                The costs of the various technologies and their fuel prices are
                based on data prior to Covid-19. One should therefore expect the
                price estimates from the simulation to underestimate the costs
                under current cirmcumstances.
              </p>
              <h3>Model Overview</h3>
              <p>
                The simulation model requires six inputs from the user, being
                the home's:
              </p>
              <ol class="fmt">
                <li>Postcode</li>
                <li>Number of Occupants</li>
                <li>Thermostat Temperature</li>
                <li>Floor Area</li>
                <li>Yearly Space Heating Energy Consumption</li>
                <li>Maximum Hot Water Tank Volume</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                From the postcode, the longitude and latitude of the home can be
                determined, which are rounded to the nearest half a degree. The
                rounded position is used to load the hourly outside temperature
                and solar radiation datasets for the location. We wish to thank
                <a href="renewables.ninja">www.renewables.ninja</a> who provided
                the weather data used by the simulator.
              </p>
              <p>
                A home’s floor area and yearly space heating energy consumption
                can usually be found on your Energy Performance Certificate
                (EPC), a legal requirement for any building sold, let or
                constructed in the UK since 2007.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the simulator only outputs the optimal hot water tank size
                for each heating system, an upper size limit is required as an inpute to ensure the simulator does not optimise for a tank size that
                could not feasibly fit into the home.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first step of the model is to estimate the thermal
                transmittance (U value) of the property. This refers to how
                quickly heat is tranferred between the property and environment.
                The U value is calculated by simulating the home’s yearly space
                heating demand at an hourly resolution using a range of U values
                from 0.5 to 3.0 in 0.01 W/m<sup>2</sup>K step increments and
                selecting the U value which results in a yearly space heating
                demand closest to that specified by the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hourly space heating demand is taken as the energy required
                to raise the inside temperature to the desired temperature. The
                inside temperature is a function of heat loss to the
                environment, and gain from body heat and solar radiation. With
                the U value calculated, the space heating demand is
                recalculated, in addition to hot water demand, using the
                inputted thermostat temperature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hot water energy consumption is a function of inlet cold water
                temperature and hot water consumption per occupant, accounting
                for daily and monthly variation. The total demand is then used
                to calculate the operational costs and emissions of the
                hydrogen, biomass and gas heating systems, by multiplying the
                energy demand with operating costs and emissions per unit energy
                respectively, whilst adjusting for system efficiencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for the electrified heating technologies, the model is more
                complex, being simulated for a range of solar thermal and
                photovoltaic ancillary technology sizes and combinations, TES
                sizes and tariffs. The peak hourly demand is used to size the
                electrified heating technologies. Each solar ancillary is
                simulated in 2m<sup>2</sup> area increments from 2m<sup>2</sup>
                up to a quarter of the inputted floor area (assumed half the
                roof area). The TES size is incremented in 0.1m<sup>3</sup>
                steps from 0.1 up to 3.0m<sup>3</sup>. As for tariff options,
                there are five, including flat-rate, night off-peak,
                evening-peak, EV off-peak and variable.For each hour over a
                year, the following steps occur.
              </p>
              <ol class="fmt">
                <li>
                  Calculate the change in inside temperature due to heat loss to
                  the environment and heat gain from body heat, solar radiation
                  and heat loss from the TES into the living space.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Update the TES state of charge due to heat loss, solar thermal
                  generation, space and hot water usage, and heat produced from
                  the electrified heating technology, powered either from grid
                  import or solar photovoltaics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Calculate operational costs from electricity import for the
                  hour using the selected tariff and operational emissions
                  associated with the solar ancillaries and grid import.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The optimal solar ancillary size, TES size and tariff is then
                  outputted to the user for each electrified heat technology -
                  solar ancillary combination, where the optimal system is
                  considered that with the lowest lifetime cost.
